I made this program with the intention of helping [my girlfriend](https://pyxelspace.com/) who is a pixel artist in her work of exporting multiple files at once, and multiple layers as well in Aseprite.
 
 ## How Works?
 1. Select the Aseprite.exe file on your computer.
 2. Select the folder that contains all the files you want to export
 3. Select a Default Output Name or Check the box to keep the original file name.
 4. Export!

## Extra Options
"Comma separated layer list" - you can choose which layers you specifically want to export. Each layer must be separated by a comma, there must be no spaces or special characters. When empty, all layers will be exported in 1 image.
Filename Suffix Conditions - I put 3 options to add suffixes to the name of the exported image respecting conditions based on the name of the .aseprite file.
Export Json Data - In addition to exporting the images, it also exports the JSON containing the data generated by Aseprite
Saving Settings - Saves your program settings, to save time on future imports, or if your computer suddenly shuts down (which happens to me a lot)
