I made this program with the intention of helping [my girlfriend](https://www.instagram.com/pyxelspace/) who is a pixel artist in her work of exporting multiple files at once, and multiple layers as well in Aseprite.
 
 ## How Works?
 1. Select the Aseprite.exe file on your computer.
 2. Select the folder that contains all the files you want to export
 3. Select a Default Output Name or Check the box to keep the original .aseprite file name.
 4. Export!

## Extra Options
"**Comma separated layer list**" - you can choose which layers you specifically want to export. Each layer must be separated by a comma. When empty, all layers will be exported in 1 image.

**Filename Suffix Conditions**- I put 3 options to add suffixes to the name of the exported image respecting conditions based on the name of the .aseprite file.
**Export Json Data** - In addition to exporting the images, it also exports the JSON containing the data generated by Aseprite

**Every layer** - When you don't want to type the name of all layers, just check this option, will export a layer per png

**Saving Settings** - Saves your program settings, to save time on future imports, or if your computer suddenly shuts down (which happens to me a lot)

ps: only .aseprite files work, because I'm an amateur =( and bad programmer, if you rename your file from .ase to .aseprite it will work, or open the *ase file with aseprite and save as .aseprite
